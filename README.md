# Auto-Release-Edited
Program that automated some of my daily repetetive and flowchart tasks. 

This program automated a large portion of my daily tasks and expedited certain company processes. 
The program works by detecting certain pixels on the screen to figure out which screen/state it is currently in. 
It then proceeds to click or type certain patterns into different forms, depending on the state of the object being examined. 
Due to privacy concerns, many comments and functions were edited out from the actual program.
